10324644 markers to be included from [ wgs.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ wgs.fam ] 
578 individuals read from [ wgs.fam ] 
0 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a disease phenotype (1=unaff, 2=aff, 0=miss)
Missing phenotype value is also -9
0 cases, 0 controls and 578 missing
0 males, 0 females, and 578 of unspecified sex
Warning, found 578 individuals with ambiguous sex codes
