Reading map (extended format) from [ autosome.bim ] 
34739081 markers to be included from [ autosome.bim ]
Reading pedigree information from [ autosome.fam ] 
576 individuals read from [ autosome.fam ] 
576 individuals with nonmissing phenotypes
Assuming a quantitative trait
Missing phenotype value is -9
222 males, 354 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
Reading genotype bitfile from [ autosome.bed ] 
Detected that binary PED file is v1.00 SNP-major mode
Reading list of ranges from [ /home/xwang/Dropbox/GitHub/wgs2/v4/v4.txt ]
Allowing a 0 kb window around each range
Added 4 distinct ranges to 4 sets
4 ranges with at least 1 marker
Assigned 4 SNPs to at least 1 range
Extracting 4 SNPs
Before frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4 SNPs
576 founders and 0 non-founders found
Total genotyping rate in remaining individuals is 1
0 SNPs failed missingness test ( GENO > 1 )
0 SNPs failed frequency test ( MAF < 0 )
After frequency and genotyping pruning, there are 4 SNPs
After filtering, 576 individuals with non-missing status
After filtering, 222 males, 354 females, and 0 of unspecified sex
